Hysteresis IB lab write-up Dec 2025
This code was written to process oscilloscope data from a CSV file.
The oscilloscope had 2 input channels corresponding to voltages V_x and V_y which were proportional to H and B respectively.
Files can be uploaded to plot B vs H hysteresis curves, curve-fit them with a polynomial, calculate the loop area (for power dissipation) and range of gradients (for mu_r)
Values of constants such as moving average window size will need tuning depending on the dataset size
